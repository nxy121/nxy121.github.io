<p>Ever since I was a little kid I always had such a huge passion for cars. From playing with hotwheels that my dad would get from the gas stattion to going to the New York Auto Show with my family, cars were always the root of my happiness. Now that I am 19 years old I am in a fortunate position where I have already owned three cars. My first car which was a 2015 BMW 228i manual in formula red was amazing, had to sell it once I moved upsate for college (had a semester at RIT). My second car which was a 2018 Audi A4 was exteremly comfterbale but was just so boring. My current car (my favorite) is a 2021 Toyota Supra which I am absolutly head over heals for. From driving it to just looking at it, it just makes me happier than anything else can. Below I have included some of my favroite car videos for you to enjoy!</p>
