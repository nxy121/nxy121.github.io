<p>When I lived in New Jersey I went to Holmdel High School in Holmdel Nj. Afer graduating college I went RIT where I was studing finance. After only one semester at RIT, I hated it. I knew it was not for me as it was an extremly anti-social university in the middle of nowhere. It was also the fact that it was always cloudy and cold which really did not help my hapiness at RIT. I ended up transferring to the University of Miami the very next semester. I also chnaged my major when I came to UM; I chnaged it to Economics and Computer science. Although it may sound like a strange combination, these major's work hand in hand in the field I want to get into after I graduate from college. After I graduate I went to get into the algorithmic trading world. Right now I am currently creating my own algorithmic trading robot using python which will really help me develop experiance in my field.</p>
