    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div>
    <p>My name is Nader Youssef and I am a sophmore here at the University of Miami where I currently I am double majoring in economics and computer science.I currently live in Trophy Club, Texas but I was raised in Holmdel, New Jersey where I grew up. Odly enough, I was born in Sweden where I lived there until I was three and moved to the United States later on. After college, with my degree, I would like to work as an investment banking analyst on Wall Street in New York City.
